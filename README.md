# Test Driven Development (sample from Thoughtworks Talks Tech SG)

My own implementation based on the Thoughtworks Talks Tech Session on Test Driven Development.

I am using Kotlin while the original video uses Java.

Every commit in this repo follows the red (test fails), green (test passes), blue (refactor) cycle.
